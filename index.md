I'm a fifth semester Computer Science (CS) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) student at Ludwig Maximilian University (University of Munich).

Previously I've worked at the biggest German Q&A platform gutefrage as a Software Engineer Working Student (Jul 2020â€“Sep 2021) and interned at Ulysees (text editor application) and tresmo (IoT firm) throughout summer break whilst in school. 

I'll put my CV (or similar) down here sometime soon when I get to it.
