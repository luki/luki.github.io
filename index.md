<h1>Introduction</h1>

Who is Lou Süsslin? A short summary of both their academic and professional career thus far.  

<h1>Academic career</h1>

    <p>I have completed completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science (Minor: Computational Linguistics) at Ludwig Maximilian University (University of Munich) in August of 2023. In the winter term of 2023/24 I looked into the Media Informatics major at Dresden University of Technology (TUD) but decided it wasn't right for me. In March of 2024, I am going to move to Vienna in March of 2024, where I will commence my studies of Data Science.</p>

<h2>Work experience</h2>
    <p>Along my academic journey I have also gained practical experience. Most recently, I have worked as a student assistant for the courses of <i>Human Computer Interaction</i> and <i>Introduction to Media Informatics</i> at TUD. My tasks included holding practice seminars, preparing slides and grading assignmenents. In three months of the summer of 2022, I have also been a student assistant in Human-AI Interaction Design for aviation at the Research Institute of the Free State of Bavaria for software-intensive Systems and Services. Additionally, I undertook internships at Ulysses, a text editor application company in Leipzig, and tresmo, an IoT firm in Augsburg, during my high school summer breaks. I have also gained experience in the industry by working as Software Engineering Working Student at the renowned German-speaking Q&A platform, gutefrage, from July 2020 to September 2021 in Munich.</p>

        <h1>Origin Story</h1>
        <p>I was born in Augsburg-Oberhausen, Southern Germany, to a working-class family with deep roots in the East Swabian town dating back to the times coined by protestant weavers in the "Free Imperial City" era (16th century and earlier). My mother is a trained postal worker, and my father worked as a demolition contractor. Both of my grandfathers were predominantly butchers and were of farm families from other areas of the culturally southwestern parts of the Alpine Foreland, predominantly Middle Swabia and East Allgovia. Meanwhile, my grandmothers were born and raised in my hometown, with one of them having more recent roots in the western end of Swabia, in Stuttgart-neighboring Esslingen. I grew up in a 7.5qm room of an apartment located in Wolfram, a working-class neighborhood in Augsburg's, now historic, Textile District.</p>
