    <h1>Short Introduction</h1>

    <p>Currently pursuing a master's degree in Media Informatics at Dresden University of Technology (TUD) and serving there as a Student Assistant for Professor Gerhard Weber's courses of Human Computer Interaction and Introduction to Media Informatics. In the summer of 2023, completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Computational Linguistics at Ludwig Maximilian University (University of Munich).</p>

    <p>Along my academic journey I have also gained practical experience through roles such as a Software Engineering Working Student at the renowned German-speaking Q&A platform, gutefrage, from July 2020 to September 2021 in Munich. For three months, I have also been a student assistant in Human-AI Interaction Design for aviation at the Research Institute of the Free State of Bavaria for software-intensive Systems and Services. Additionally, I undertook internships at Ulysses, a text editor application company in Leipzig, and tresmo, an IoT firm in Augsburg, during my high school summer breaks.</p>

        <h1>Origin Story</h1>
        <p>I was born in Augsburg-Oberhausen to a working-class family with deep roots in East Swabian Augsburg dating back to the time of protestant weavers in the "Free Imperial City" era (16th century and earlier). My mother is a trained postal worker, and my father worked as a demolition contractor. Both of my grandfathers were predominantly butchers who came from Swabian farm families in the former counties of Kaufbeuren and Mindelheim. Meanwhile, my grandmothers were born and raised in my hometown, with one of them having more recent roots extending to the western end of Swabia, in Stuttgart-neighboring Esslingen. I grew up in Wolfram, a working-class neighborhood that is part of the Textile District.</p>
