        <h1>More background on me</h1>
        <p>I was born into a Swabian workers family in Augsburg with roots in the city reaching back to protestant weavers in the "Free Imperial City" until at least the 16th century. Both my grandfathers originate from Swabian farm families, while my grandmothers were both born in my hometown; one of them even has partial roots in the other (western) end of Swabia – Stuttgart. The popular Swabian work attitude, that's present in my family, as well as the reality of having workers as parents have shaped my mind of thinking: To always wanting to keep going; to always wanting to prove my worth.<br>The fact that I have grown up in the Textile District of Augsburg (home to mostly German and immigrant workers, including former refugees of the "Old Eastern" provinces of Germany) has only added to that.</p>
