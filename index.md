    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Enrolled in Media Informatics at Dresden University of Technology (TUD) for the winter term 2023/24 and serving as a Student Assistant for Professor Gerhard Weber's courses of <i>Human Computer Interaction</i> and <i>Introduction to Media Informatics</i> whilst. In the summer of 2023, I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Computational Linguistics at Ludwig Maximilian University (University of Munich). Moving onto another degree and university next term.</p>

    <p>Along my academic journey I have also gained practical experience through roles such as a Software Engineering Working Student at the renowned German-speaking Q&A platform, gutefrage, from July 2020 to September 2021 in Munich. For three months, I have also been a student assistant in Human-AI Interaction Design for aviation at the Research Institute of the Free State of Bavaria for software-intensive Systems and Services. Additionally, I undertook internships at Ulysses, a text editor application company in Leipzig, and tresmo, an IoT firm in Augsburg, during my high school summer breaks.</p>

        <h1>Origin Story</h1>
        <p>I was born in Augsburg-Oberhausen, Southern Germany, to a working-class family with deep roots in the East Swabian town dating back to the times coined by protestant weavers in the "Free Imperial City" era (16th century and earlier). My mother is a trained postal worker, and my father worked as a demolition contractor. Both of my grandfathers were predominantly butchers and were of farm families from other areas of the culturally southwestern parts of the Alpine Foreland, predominantly Middle Swabia and East Allgovia. Meanwhile, my grandmothers were born and raised in my hometown, with one of them having more recent roots in the western end of Swabia, in Stuttgart-neighboring Esslingen. I grew up in a 7.5qm room of an apartment located in Wolfram, a working-class neighborhood in Augsburg's, now historic, Textile District.</p>
