    <h1>Short Introduction</h1>

    <p>I'm a Computer Science and Natural Language Processing student at Ludwig Maximilian University (University of Munich). </p>

    <p>Previously I've worked at the biggest German-speaking Q&A platform <i>gutefrage</i> as a Software Engineering Working Student (Jul 2020–Sep 2021, Munich) and interned at <i>Ulysses</i> (text editor application, Leipzig) and <i>tresmo</i> (IoT firm, Augsburg) throughout summer break whilst in school.</p>
    
    <p>Some of my other other work includes university projects such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(<a href="https://github.com/luki/programmiersprache-l">1</a>) a logical programming language written in Haskell; and </li>
            <li>(<a href="https://github.com/luki/alleviating-struggles-in-the-office">2</a>) a "media informatics" seminar paper on leveraging mobile sensors to tackle (health) issues in offices</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>In my spare time, amongst other activites, I produce techno music under the artist name <i>Awkward Endeavor</i> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/awkwardendeavor">SoundCloud</a> | <a href="https://awkwardendeavor.bandcamp.com">bandcamp</a>() | <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2qegQdSFPKUy3swzN1pRqT?si=pv80FJk1ROaqtdZEmw9zxQ">Spotify</a></p>

        <h1>More background on me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Augsburg-Oberhausen into a Swabian workers family with roots in Augsburg reaching back to protestant weavers in the "Free Imperial City" until at least the 16th century. Both my grandfathers originate from Swabian farm families, while my grandmothers were both born in my hometown; one of them even has partial roots in the other (western) end of Swabia – Stuttgart. The popular Swabian work attitude, that's present in my family, as well as the reality of having workers as parents have shaped my mind of thinking: To always wanting to keep going; to always wanting to prove my worth.<br>The fact that I have grown up in the Textile District of Augsburg (home to mostly German and immigrant workers, including former refugees of the "Old Eastern" provinces of Germany) has only added to that.</p>
