## Current Situation
Currently, I am a junior at Holbein-Gymnasium Augsburg, a university/college-preparatory school. It may be interesting to know that Rudolf Diesel, the inventor of the Diesel engine, though I plead for electric engines nowadays.
Beside studies, I spend my time reading about various topics, i.a. Computer Science, politics and philosophy or programming some [projects](http://github.com/luki). Additionally, I play the guitar (acoustic and electric) and write as well, as can be seen on this blog. Irregularly, I also try to study Japanese. I know Hiragana and Katakana and some kanji so far.

## Experience
### Work
* Aug 9th - Sep 8th, 2017
  * Software Development Intern
  * At [**tresmo GmbH**](https://www.tresmo.de/en/), Augsburg
  * What I've learned by digitalizing a foosball table:
    * Plan architecture (Backend, technologies, etc.)

  * At [**cobe GmbH**](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/), Munich
  * My tasks at this rather short internship (Tuesday - Friday) were:
    * Cut-out players for the iOS application KKSTR/Kickbase
    * Prepare some parts for the Press Kit of an iOS application (e.g. iPhone mockups)
  * Had to commute daily, which was somewhat unplesant, but bearable

_Conclusion_: Thanks to these internships, I've concluded that I do not want to work at agencies in the future. I am very grateful for these opportunities and for all that I have learnt while being there.

## Future
### Studies/Work
Finals exams are coming up in Spring 2019, afterward, I would like to major in Computer Science, preferably in the US or at Technical University of Munich. As of now, I believe I'd like to focus on IT Security, as well as Machine Learning/Artifical Intelligence. What may come post-academics, I haven't thought of as of now. Working at companies such as Dropbox or Spotify seems worthwhile, though becoming a professor and/or researcher is at least as tempting.

### Living
Eventually, I'd love to live in the west of the US, maybe California, alternatively somewhere in Oregon or Seattle, Washington. However, after having spent nearly a week in Japan, I would also like to spend a year or two over there, possibly in Osaka.
