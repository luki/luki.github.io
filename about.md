## Current Situation
Currently, I am a senior at Holbein-Gymnasium Augsburg, a university/college-preparatory school. It may be interesting to know that Rudolf Diesel, the inventor of the Diesel engine. 
Beside studies, I spend my time reading about various topics, i.a. Computer Science, politics and philosophy or programming some [projects](http://github.com/luki). Additionally, I play the guitar (acoustic and electric) and write as well, as can be seen on this blog. 

## Experience
### Work
* July 30th - Aug 10th, 2018
  * Software Development Intern
  * At [**Ulysses GmbH & Co. KG**](https://www.ulysses.app), Leipzig
  * Throughout this internship, I worked on two internal tools (+ programming languages/technologies):
    * Mac Menu Bar (Objjuniorective-C)
    * Safari Browser Extension (Swift, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery)
  * Besides, I got insights into some procedures in Software Development, as well as in design at Ulysses.
* Aug 9th - Sep 8th, 2017
  * Software Development Intern
  * At [**tresmo GmbH**](https://www.tresmo.de/en/), Augsburg
  * What I've learned by digitalizing a foosball table:
    * Plan architecture (Backend, technologies, etc.)
    * Node.js (REST), Express and Socket.io for backend
    * Vue.js & Vuex for frontend
* August 2015, 4 days
  * Graphic Design Internship
  * At [**cobe GmbH**](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/), Munich
  * My tasks at this rather short internship (Tuesday - Friday) were:
    * Cut-out players for the iOS application KKSTR/Kickbase
    * Prepare some parts for the Press Kit of an iOS application (e.g. iPhone mockups)
  * Had to commute daily, which was somewhat unplesant, but bearable

_Conclusion_: Thanks to these internships, I've concluded that I do not want to work at agencies in the future. I am very grateful for these opportunities and for all that I have learnt while being there.

## Future
### Studies/Work
Finals exams are coming up in Spring 2019, afterward, I would like to major in Computer Science, preferably in the US or at Technical University of Munich. As of now, I believe I'd like to focus on IT Security, as well as Machine Learning/Artifical Intelligence. What may come post-academics, I haven't thought of as of now. Working at companies such as Dropbox or Spotify seems worthwhile, though becoming a professor and/or researcher is at least as tempting.

### Living
Eventually, I'd love to live in the west of the US. Portland, Seattle, Salt Lake City and Phoenix seem great.
