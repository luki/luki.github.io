Last week, I got to present my research on a social inequality in Germany. The task was to pick an inequality, find supporting news articles that prove it that aren’t older than 2 years and sum it up on one DIN A4 page in a certain format.

I went for ‘Sexuality as an inequality’ and got 100% (15 points) on my presentation + work. Since I love sharing findings, I liberally translated my work, as well as the quotes I incorporated.

## 1. Description: Lower hourly wages of homosexual men
The social inequality I would like to address is the sexuality of people. While researching whether it occurs as a social inequality or not, I stumbled across reports of multiple well-known newspapers (e.g. Zeit, Sueddeutsche, Spiegel) on a study of the German Institute of Economic Research. The research study in question reports on points to lower wages of homosexual men. Inter alia, 'Die Zeit' reports some of the following:

> “On average, gay men receive smaller hourly wages than heterosexual men in the German labor market. The difference between gross hourly wages amounts to about 2.14 euros…”

While heterosexual men earn 18 euros, a homosexual man only earns 15.86 euros, meaning 12% less in the same hours of working hours. A lot of money, considering that 2.14 euros account to about 24.2% of the minimum wage (8.84 euros).

> “With factors such as age, education, and industry taken into account gays get paid 2.64 euros less than homosexual with same characteristics. Gay men, lesbian women and bisexual people are better educated than the average according to a survey.”

This means that gay men, given the same conditions as age and industry, earn less than their heterosexual counterparts, despite the fact they’ve been more well educated.

## Countermeasure: More studies/data on homosexual people
Since more studies would portrait the described inequality in more detail, it would eventually prove or discount whether or not the lower wages are actually a discrimination against homosexual men or not. Regarding this, the authors of the study say that this “has not yet statistically proven a wage discrimination of gay men at the workplace”.
Moreover, the reduction of homophobia is likely. Since more data raises the awareness of the living conditions of homosexual people, this might eventually lead to the change of the behavior of society. The European Union pleads for my second reasons as well according to the ‘Zeit’: “Even the EU recommends to regularly share comparable data on conditions of lesbian women, gay men and bisexual and transsexual people in order to control homophobia and sexual discrimination”.
