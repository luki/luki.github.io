An Unconventional Method of Brainstorming
An idea of [Lukas A. Mueller](http://lukasam.com) and [Axel Boberg](http://axelboberg.se)

## Introduction
Most likely everyone has played 'telephone', also known as 'Chinese whispers'
in British English, a children's game in which the first player whispers a
phrase or word in someone else's ear and they, in turn, repeat the latter.
The last person in this more or less recursive process announces the word
they have been told. More often than not, the outcome is *very different
compared to the initial word*. The result is comparable to the described method
hereinafter - Subset Distribution, as Axel and I called it back in August 2017.

## Explanation
Any idea is divided into 'chunks', none of which should - at best - imply what
the whole picture has been up to that particular moment.
Now, anyone should be assigned a chunk, which they are ought to proceed
developing regardless how trivial it supposedly seems. The foundational
principle is to contrive new concepts. Later on, all participants are supposed
to gather and share their ideas. The 'brainstorming lead' along with the
participants' help, is now supposed to "put the pieces together", as called in
the vernacular.

## Note
Worth noting is, that a collection might end up cluttered if not meticulously
organized and considered. This might very well prove to be more difficult the
larger a collective grows. A personal suggestion to prevent derangements in the
first place, or counteract at a later point of time, is minimalism.
